# Decentralized Freelance Marketplace

## Project Description
The Decentralized Freelance Marketplace is a smart contract-based platform that allows clients to post jobs and freelancers to accept and complete them in a trustless environment. It eliminates the need for centralized freelancing platforms by using Ethereum smart contracts to manage job postings, escrow payments, and job completions securely.

## Project Vision
To empower freelancers and employers with a transparent, low-fee, censorship-resistant system for remote work transactions.

## Key Features
- Clients can post jobs with escrowed payments
- Freelancers can browse and accept available jobs
- Payments are released upon client-confirmed job completion
- Events for all key interactions (posting, accepting, completion)
- Open job records query

## Future Scope
- Implement decentralized dispute resolution
- Add support for milestone-based payments
- Introduce a rating/reputation system
- Enable on-chain job search with filters
- Upgrade to multi-chain compatibility
